# actions
- Testing diferent Github actions workflows
- Adding a Lint PR workflow to check the PR title
- If I do not find a way to modify the "Merge pull request #.." automatic commit log we need to remove the Squash Commit options on the repo in order to work (then not sure the previous Lint PR workflow has sense)
    - Using the redefined github to change the PR commit message (but does not work), if not there is a chrome extension
